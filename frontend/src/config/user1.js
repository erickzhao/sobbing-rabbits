    "Its proving grounds were the streets, autobahns and mountain switchbacks of Europe, and now the Honda CBF600SA is earning the same solid reputation right here in Canada. Whether you're an experienced rider or newer to motorcycling and ready to move up from a smaller bike, you'll love the CBF600SA's 599 cc DOHC inline-four engine with its smooth, responsive powerband. The engine is tuned to deliver extra punch at low rpm levels \u2014 exactly the kind of tractable, right-there power you want for busy city streets and curving country roads. A low seat height is adjustable up or down for added comfort, and a sculpted half-fairing with adjustable windscreen flows air around you to keep you comfortable even when rain clouds roll in and the temperature drops. And when the rain does start to fall, you'll really appreciate Honda's Combined Braking System with ABS, which provides remarkable control even on less-than-ideal road surfaces.",
